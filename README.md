Null Hypothesis: If the number of individuals who have died by suicide amongst millenials has increased since 2005, then the number of veterans who have died by suicide within the same age group has decreased.

# Additional questions we will attempt to answer:
Amongst veterans is the suicide rate higher for females than males, and how does it compare to the general population?
What methods are used most often used by veterans who have died by suicide?
How does the age of veterans who have died by suicide vary in comparison to the general population?
