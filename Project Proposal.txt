US Veteran Suicide Exploration

We will be examining suicide data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

Hypothesis: The veteran suicide rate is higher than the overall population rate.
Null Hypothesis: The overall population suicide rate is lower than the veteran sucide rate.

We will compare suicide rates on the national and state level.
